Website Design for Everybody Capstone Site
I'm designed and built a website made with Bootstrap. It's a site meant to lightheartedly make fun of and simultaneously educate others on the importance of good user experience. It's an online repository of designs gone wrong where users will look at other examples of bad design both in the digital world and in real-life situations. Additionally, I want to a include a page explaining what user experience encompasses and what it's really about. 

Enhancements:
- "Back to top" link seen in footer menu
- Fully responsive at any screen size (greater than 2 viewports)
- Favicon integration
- Put through WAVE tool with no major errors or alerts
